title: "Research Project - <em>Alternative Media Ecosystems</em>"
excerpt: "This research stream engages explicitly with media environments deeply affected by religion, rurality, and radio. Currently, I am exploring the Utah media ecosystem as an insightful case study, mapping actors, networks, technologies, digital identities, and cultural/ideological influences.  <br/><br/><img src='/images/oil-carbon.jpeg'>

This project was funded by the EU's Horizon Europe scheme, via a Marie Curie award, between 2024 and 2025. ["Considering Rurality and Religion: Mapping an Alternative Media Ecosystem and Addressing Gaps in Misinformation Research"](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101109725) has been awarded approximately $250,000 for two years.

At the core of this multi-year project are intense periods of data collection around US elections. Research began with the 2022 US midterm elections and have continued with each major election cycle. The next planned collection period will be the 2026 midterm elections. There are substantial ethnographic components to the project design (in-person observation, local immersion, and interviews). Data collected also includes media content, from broadcast transmissions at scale to news stories to social media content.   

Given this project's on-the-ground nature and focus in highly conservative communities, outcomes of this project are also oriented toward bettering this type of research. First steps included an inaugural preconference at the 2024 American Sociological Association entitled ['On-The-Ground Research with the Right in 2024'](https://researchwiththeright.wordpress.com/). 

While the aim of this project is an eventual manuscript, initial findings have been presented at several invited talks and conference venues. For example, I have presented findings on the journalistic roles and conflicted identities of rural talk radio stations at:
- Harvard University's [Politics and Social Change Workshop](https://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/event/politics-and-social-change-workshop-09-26-24) (26 September 2024)
- [Association of Internet Researchers Conference](https://aoir.org/aoir2024/) (1 November 2024)
