I am an early career media sociologist with a PhD from Cambridge University. <b>Broadly, my work uncovers and analyses understudied media ecosystems, particularly those with insightful relations to the ‘traditional press’ and concepts of dis/misinformation. I pay special attention to sociotechnical change, reproduction of discourse, and power relations within these systems.</b> My scholarly sites of inquiry include:
- Conservative talk radio stations in rural Utah (and [ethnographic work in conservative spaces](https://researchwiththeright.wordpress.com/));
- The [new global network of fact checkers funded by social media platform content moderation contracts](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/19851); 
- [Search engine manipulation of journalists and activists](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444820912534) around a controversial 2010s privacy regulation. 

Informed by cultural studies, media sociology, and conjunctural analysis, I use a blend of ethnographic, textual, and network mapping methods. My work also engages in reflexive critique of digital media research methods.


I am an Assistant Professor at [MIT's Comparative Media Studies department](https://cmsw.mit.edu/); I also maintain affiliations at the [Berkman Klein Center](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/rebekah-larsen) (Harvard) and the [Center for Governance and Human Rights](https://www.cghr.polis.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-rebekah-larsen/) (Cambridge). Previously, I was a [Marie Curie Fellow](https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/rebekah-ann-larsen) at the University of Copenhagen in the Communications Department.
